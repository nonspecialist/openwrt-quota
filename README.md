# OpenWRT Quotas

This is an (initially) simple project to implement per-user
(actually, per-device) usage quotas.

## Initial scope

1. Per-device separate quotas
1. Quotas reset on a schedule, via `cron`

## Later

1. Quota pools so multiple devices can be in one pool (eg Kid A has a phone, tablet, and laptop in the same pool)
1. GUI
